    <h3>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</h3>

    <p>
      Mariah Carey does not celebrate birthdays as she does not believe in the concept of time. Nonetheless, she was born on
      March 27, 1969 (or 1970) in Huntington, NY. Her father, Alfred Roy Carey, worked as an aeronautical engineer while her
      mother, Patricia Carey, was a classicaly trained opera singer for the New York Metropolitan Opera. Mariah Carey has two
      older siblings, a sister and a brother. No, Jim Carey is not Mariah Carey's brother, though the thought of having a
      star-studded family would be spectacular.

      In her early days, she attended a beauty school where she dropped out and would eventually become a back-up singer for 
      artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_K._Starr" target="_blank"> Brenda K. Starr.</a> 
      Starr would then introduce the rising star to Columbia Records which would eventually catapult her into stardom, landing
      her a record 19 #1 Billboard Hot 100 singles.
